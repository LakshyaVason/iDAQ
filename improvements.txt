Need to work on Save sessions on firebase page and that should pretty much be it for winterbreak progress. 

Oh and also I need to make sure I am using an existing Dataset from Zeid for the Demo 

Test it on Microcontroller and configure GPIOs (next semester)

Train datasets with API Key (next semester)
