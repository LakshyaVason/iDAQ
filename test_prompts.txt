2. **Test follow-ups:** Multi-turn conversations reveal memory
3. **Mix domains:** Power electronics + control theory
4. **Challenge assumptions:** "Why not...?" questions
5. **Test limits:** Very specific vs very vague prompts

**Remember:** The goal is to find weaknesses so you can improve the system before your demo! 🎯
